> ImGUI menu template for various graphic rendering frameworks 

## Compatible APIs
  - DirectX9 (DirectX9Ex)
  - DirectX12
  - OpenGL
  
## Purpose
This is a menu template upon which you can build any mod menu you like \
It will find the injected process window, and attempt to hook with your specified API.
You are given a small ImGUI window with a title and exit button, along with a preset class for defining hack variables called MenuVars (in config.h)

## Usage
- Clone this repo
- Open library.cpp
- Find and change the rendering framework to your game's framework in library.cpp under DllMain E.G to: 
```C++
Rendering::SetFramework(Framework::DIRECTX9);
```
- Build and inject the DLL into your game, ensure you build for the correct platform, x86 for 32 bit games, x64 for 64 bit games
- Proceed to build your menu from this framework

## Key information
- You'll find the menu style under menu->menu.cpp->CreateStyle()
- Menu rendering is done within menu->menu.cpp->Render(), this is where you'll notice the menu button being drawn. Your menu design will go here, move it to a seperate function if you wish.
- You can disable the debug console from within console->console.h, uncomment the DISABLE_LOGGING macro
- You will find custom logging macros in console.h including PRINT_CUSTOM and PRINT_CUSTOM_COLOR you can use these to print standard, or colored text using the following format:
```C++
PRINT_CUSTOM_COLOR(FOREGROUND_RED, "[YourMenuName]", "ESP Loaded");
PRINT_CUSTOM("[YourMenuName]", "ESP Loaded");
```
Which will print `[YourMenuName] ESP Loaded` in red, and your normal terminal background color respectively
- This was written in JetBrain's CLion using CMakeLists, which defines build instructions for the project

## How it works

### DirectX
By creating a `placeholder` or `dummy` device and swapchain (specifically for DirectX10 and later) and linking them to the console window handle. the program obtains a reference to the `vTable` in order to access the API's function addresses. It then release these resources as they're not used after acquiring the vTable. From there, `MinHook` is used to hook into specified methods, meaning the `ImGUI` code can be rendered.

### OpenGL
Easier than DirectX that's for sure. OpenGL exports wglSwapBuffers, which is then hooked much like using DirectX. But instead of creating a dummy device, the program gets the module handle of opengl32, then gets the exported function address directly. \
From there, Minhook hooks in the custom method which handles the rendering of the menu.

## Todo
- DX10
- DX11
- ~~OpenGL~~
- Vulkan

Note that the ImGUI implementation classes for these APIs are already in the project, but there is no hooking code for these functions yet.
